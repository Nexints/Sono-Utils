This is a custom fork of [TootieJin](https://tootiejin.com)'s fork of [Nanashi's Overlay Software](https://github.com/sevenc-nanashi) (taken down) with non-Project Sekai assets, intended to provide my custom Rhythm Game skin towards Sonolus custom charts.

Sono-Overlay currently supports the following servers:
- ProSeka Servers:
  - Sekai Rush (sekai-best-)
  - SSS (sss-)
- Custom ProSeka Servers:
  - Chart Cyanvas (chcy-)
    - 0: Archive
    - 1: Offshoot
  - Potato Leaves (ptlv-)
  - Untitled Sekai (utsk-)
  - Untitled Charts (unch-)
  - Next Sekai (coconut-next-sekai-)
  - ScoreSync (sync-)
- Official Game Servers:
  - Sonolus Horizon (coconut-horizon-) / NEW Expansion (BETA)
- Local File Support (*.json.gz)
- More coming!

Sono-Overlay has these extended features compared to the originals:
- Dynamic Stage Support
- Sonolus Horizon Support
- Custom Watermarks (& Moving Watermarks)
- `yt-dlp` Integration (add `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`, and `ffprobe` to an addons folder!)
- Primary [AviUtl ExEdit 2](https://mints.ne.jp) Support
- Local File Support (*.json.gz)

Sono-Overlay has these features planned:
- High:
  - Custom ID (for a custom server)
  - Bundled Local Server
- Low:
  - Skill Cards
  - More Addons

Sono-Overlay will not implement these features:
- Score Maker Support
- AviUtl support (AviUtl ExEdit 2 is better)
- v1 UI support (legacy support for a UI that no longer exists)

## How to use

Required programs:
- [AviUtl ExEdit 2](https://mints.ne.jp)
- LSMASH WORKS
- MP4 Exporter
- Powershell

Required Clips:
- Sonolus Gameplay with white background
- Sonolus Gameplay with black background
- Remember to hide the UI!

Additional Notes:
- English language for AviUtl ExEdit 2 is selectable in `設定 > 言語の設定 > English` ( `Settings > Language > English`)
- If you're using AviUtl ExEdit 2, import the `AviUtl2\lwinput.aui2` and `MP4Exporter.auo2` plugin to `C:\ProgramData\aviutl2\Plugin` folder
- The recommended font is RodinNTLG DB + EB.
- System locale must be `Japanese (Japan)`, and `Japanese Language Pack` must be installed. This is a restriction with the AviUtl ExEdit program.
- While the program will work without the Japanese Language Pack or the Japanese System Locale, **I hold no guarantees the output of this program will be usable.**
- For the clips: Please make sure all clips are passed through FFMPEG or your video editor of choice. AviUtl ExEdit 2 has a syncing problem and visual bugs if you record on IOS.

### Step-step guide:
0. Install required programs
1. Download the latest version of Sono-Overlay
2. Unzip all files in a directory without non-ACII characters, and make sure this directory does not require admin permissions.
4. Once the programs are installed, run the `Sono-Overlay.exe` file, and follow the steps given by the program.
**Note: Select AviUtl ExEdit2 (`2`).** AviUtl (normal) is kept for legacy reasons.
5. Create a new project in AviUtl ExEdit 2
6. Import the .object or the .exo file from the `{Sono-Overlay Directory}\dist\[Chart ID]` into the project by drag and dropping.

This video element uses `Unmult`. If your video element does not have this, you are looking at the wrong `Video file`.

7. Click the bottom `Video File` (just above the `root@sono-overlay`), click `File`, and then select your `Black BG Video`. 

This video element uses the blending mode `Multiply`. If your video element does not have this, you are looking at the wrong `Video file`.

8. Click the `Video File` just above the Step 7 video file, click `File`, and then select your `White BG Video`. 

Step 8 is needed to ensure Dynamic Stage support.

9. Make sure both videos in steps 7 and 8 are synced, and adjust the video / audio positioning as necessary.
10. If needed, go to the `Root@sono-overlay` file, and adjust the `Offset`.
11. When finished, export your video as mp4. (Assuming AviUtl ExEdit2: `File > Export > MP4 Exporter (by えすご/Esugo)`)

Play around with this tool, and tweak the settings as you wish~
